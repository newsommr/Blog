            According to <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en"> Google's transparency report</a>, 96% of pages loaded on Chrome in the United States are using HTTPS.

            This is an incredible statistic. Earlier in the decade, it was not as commonplace to have non financial sites using encryption. I would personally attribute a huge help of this adoption rate to <a href="letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>
            which is a non-profit who provides free TLS certificates to any site who needs one. Using encryption on your site can improve it in the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Provides integrity. No one else can intercept what your site is sending to your users and modifying it.</li>
                <li>Prevents other people/providers from reading the communications between your site and your users which adds privacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Adding a TLS certificate to your website is easy thanks to Let's Encrypt.
            <a href="https://ibb.co/G56zBf9"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZMjqtRS/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-5-19-47-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-5-19-47-PM" border="0"></a><br>
            Certbot is a tool created by the <a href="eff.org">EFF</a> and it automates the process of installing the TLS certificate. It also automates the renewal process once the current certificate
            expires after 3 months. Once you SSH into your server, you can easily install the certificate by typing the following commands: <br>
            <p>
            sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core<br>
            sudo snap install --classic certbot<br>
            sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot<br>
            <span>And assuming you are using Apache (which you are if you are in this class) then you just use this and it'll automatically change your apache configuration:</span><br>
            sudo certbot --apache<br>
            sudo certbot renew --dry-run<span> (This tests to make sure the auto renewal works correctly.)</span><br>
            </p>
            And now your site should be visible over a https connection. Try it!
