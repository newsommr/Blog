            I watched a short but highly detailed video on YouTube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salY_Sm6mv4"> HTML explained in 5 minutes. </a>
	    It detailed some of the history of <strong>HTML</strong> but mostly went through the <em>basics</em>
	    that one would need to know before starting to code in <strong>HTML</strong>. For instance, it displayed how to use the <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> tags
	    that I used in the last sentence. To make words be bold and italic, you use the "strong" and "em" tags, respectfully. <br> <br>
	    Another interesting thing that the video mentioned was the lists in html. The unordered lists seem particularly interesting to me because
 	    it can make tutorials much easier for someone else to read. Instead of just giving instructions in one line like this: <br> <br> Step one: Visit google.com. Step 2: Go to privacy settings. Step 3: Turn off all personalized advertisements <br> <br>You can use either the ordered or unordered list to make it much easier for the reader to follow along. <br>
	    <ul> </center>
 	    	<li>Go to google.com</li>
		<li>Open privacy settings</li>
		<li>Disable personalized advertising</li>
 	    </ul> <br>
	    This was done using the "ul" (unordered list) tag. There is a screenshot below that comes from the video that I linked above.
