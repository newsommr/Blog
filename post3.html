            This week I look through Mozilla's MDN Web Docs about iframes. It goes into a huge amount of detail about how iframes can be used to embed content from other websites
            onto your site. This can be useful as it would be hard to show content on your site when you don't own it. This allows you to show your site viewers a sort of frame of
            the other site. Your purposes for using iframes could be to show a youtube video, a wikipedia entry on a topic you are discussing, or simply add a comment section to the
            bottom of your blog using a site such as Disqus.
            </p>
            <p>
            I will be using Mozilla's post as a guide to embed the wikipedia page for James Madison University.
            To imbed a webpage, you use the &lt;iframe&gt; tag and you give it a 'src=' just like you would when you create a hyperlink to another webpage.
            You can also customize the iframe with a custom width and height. For context, the JMU wikipedia page below was given a width of 100% and a height of 590.
            The width can change how much of the embedded page is shown. Right now, you can see most of the page but it is a little compact. If you are feeling up to it
            you can use inspect element on this page and change the width to 150% to try it out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The full code for the iframe that I used on this page is below:
            </p>
            <p id ="code"style="font-weight: bold; border">
                &lt;iframe style="margin-top: 1em;" src = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison_University" width="100%" height="590">
                &lt;/iframe&gt;
            </p>
            <iframe style="margin-top: 1em;" src = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison_University" width="100%" height="590">
            </iframe>
            </article>
    </body>
