                    Imagine that you are teaching CS 347 in Spring 2022. How would you design your version of the course? What would you have the students do? 
                    What helped you learn the material of this course and what do you think would help your students learn?
                    <br><br>For my version of this course I will talk about things that I would keep from this semester and a few changes I think
                    would make it work better. <br><br>First, I think the flipped classroom model was perfect for this class. It was very beneficial
                    to come to class and work together on the lab. There were definitely a lot of difficult concepts that I would have had a 
                    hard time doing without working with my partner or getting help from the instructor. I would definitely keep that structure of the course.<br><br> Second, I think the course did a good job
                    of showing various big topics in regards to web development. We started with traditional html, then to javascript, and then finally to react.
                    It is impossible to cover everything but this gave all of the building blocks needed to create our own sites if we have the desire.
                    <br><br>
                    I am not going to be too hard on this course because it is new but I would feel better if the students recieved feedback on their
                    work quicker. When we eventually moved on to javascript, we still continued to use html and it would have been nice to have recieved feedback
                    on our first project before we submitted our second project.
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing I would change is the project structure. I feel like it would had been very beneficial to have our projects build on each other.
                    We would start out with our static site and eventually update the site to include javascript and then add in react. It would be cool to see how
                    the site adapts over the semester with the different technology.
                    <br><br>
                    One minor critique of the course I have is the conflicting instructions. Sometimes during the semester we would have to read
                    Prof. Johnson's blog for an assignment overview and it would include information that would only apply to his section. I would definitely
                    try to make those small course differences more consistent (example: submitting assignments is different for Prof. Johnson's section).
                    <br><br>
                    This class has been very informative and fun so I would like to thank you for a good semester :)
